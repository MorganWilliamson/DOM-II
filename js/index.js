/* Recommended options: 
* `mouseover`
* `keydown`
* `wheel`
* `load`
* `focus`
* `resize`
* `scroll`
* `select`
* `dblclick`
* `drag / drop`

* Note: Drag and drop is a bit more advanced than the others: it's not actually a single type of event but several types that need to work together.
   
* [ ] Nest two similar events somewhere in the site and prevent the event propagation properly. Remember not all event types bubble.
* [ ] Stop the navigation items from refreshing the page by using `preventDefault()`
